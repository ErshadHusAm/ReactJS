React class notes:

class 1
Render method is must in class components
Functional components are stateless
Class components are stateful

class 2
Where we need to store some information / state we will use class comp. else we wll always use functional comps to show informations as an UI.
Destructuring Component from react also works as same
Using JSX makes code simple and readable
How to write JSX in React Vanilla JS ?
in JSX class === className
in JSX for === htmlFor
in JSX onclick === onClick 

class 3
props are read only

Pure Component - Stops unnecessary render method calling. Also works as an aternative of shouldComponentUpdate().
If make parent component PureComponent then all child components will be PureComponent
*PureComponent is for class components
*Memo is used for functional component for same purpose

Refs - 
It is used in place of getElementById for the same purpose;
Also used to focus an input field on page load = this.firstNameRef.current.focus()

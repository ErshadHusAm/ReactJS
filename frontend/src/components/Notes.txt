React class notes:

class 1
Render method is must in class components
Functional components are stateless
Class components are stateful

class 2
Where we need to store some information / state we will use class comp. else we wll always use functional comps to show informations as an UI.
Destructuring Component from react also works as same
Using JSX makes code simple and readable
How to write JSX in React Vanilla JS ?
in JSX class === className
in JSX for === htmlFor
in JSX onclick === onClick 

class 3
props are read only

Pure Component - Stops unnecessary render method calling. Also works as an aternative of shouldComponentUpdate().
If make parent component PureComponent then all child components will be PureComponent
*PureComponent is for class components
*Memo is used for functional component for same purpose

== Refs - 
It is used in place of getElementById for the same purpose;
Also used to focus an input field on page load = this.firstNameRef.current.focus()
Component mapping - Use functions and methods of one comp in another comp can be enabled using refs. 
Find Example in -  FocusComp.js

Used to reuse component and enable better performance
Create a Class Component as HOC, then create a functional component to receive a child comp as parameter. then create 
a class component inside with all functionalities which will return the received child comp after utilizing all
functionalities. 
The normal components which wants to use the functionalities of HOC should import the HOC in their body and the export
themslef with the HOC as parameter. (Find all example in HOC folder & CLickComp & HoverComp)
**always declare {...this.props} to get all passed props dynamically

**Context API**

1. Create the Context
2. Provide Context value
3. Consume the context value
